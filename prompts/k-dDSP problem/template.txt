[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This problem is known as the multi-hop influence maximization problem (k-dDSP)---d-hop coverage is considered. More specifically, in the k-dDSP the task is to find a set U ⊆ V of cardinality k such that the set C_U ⊆ V of nodes that are covered (or influenced) by U is of maximal cardinality. Hereby, a node v forms part of C_U---that is, v is said to be covered (or influenced) by U---if there exists a node v' ∈ U such that the shortest directed path from v' to v consists of at most d arcs.

Consider the following equation to assign a probability range to each node: 
\text{Influence(N)} = \text{sigmoid}\left(\alpha_1 \cdot (1 - (\beta_1 - IDN)) + \alpha_2 \cdot (1 - (\beta_2 - ODN)) + \alpha_3 \cdot (1 - (\beta_3 - CC)) + \alpha_4 \cdot (1 - (\beta_4 - BC)) + \alpha_5 \cdot (1 - (\beta_5 - PR)) \right)
- Alpha: Represents the weighting coefficients assigned to each metric in the influence calculation. The sum of all alpha values must equal 1 (\(\sum_{i=1}^{5} \alpha_i = 1\)), and each alpha value could be different, inferring the proper distribution representing the importance among the metrics. Each alpha coefficient (\(\alpha_{i}\)) is constrained to the range (0, 1). 
- Beta: Represents a factor of desirable results for each metric, indicating their relative importance. Each beta value (\(\beta_{i}\)) is independent and constrained to the range (0, 1). The beta value indicates where the favorable values are expected relative to the metrics; it serves as a repair parameter.
The goal is to identify patterns in the selection of nodes for the solution of Graph 1 (for example) and to consider the metrics from Graph 2 to infer the values of alpha and beta.
The response must be in the following format:
alpha_1={{value_alpha_1}}
alpha_2={{value_alpha_2}}
alpha_3={{value_alpha_3}}
alpha_4={{value_alpha_4}}
alpha_5={{value_alpha_5}}
beta_1={{value_beta_1}}
beta_2={{value_beta_2}}
beta_3={{value_beta_3}}
beta_4={{value_beta_4}}
beta_5={{value_beta_5}}
