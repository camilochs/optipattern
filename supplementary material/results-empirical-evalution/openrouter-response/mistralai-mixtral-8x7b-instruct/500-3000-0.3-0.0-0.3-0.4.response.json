The sum of all alpha values equals 1, and each alpha value is different, indicating the importance among the metrics.\n\nThe beta values represent a factor of desirable results for each metric, indicating their relative importance. Each beta value is independent and constrained to the range (0, 1), indicating where the favorable values are expected relative to the metrics.
