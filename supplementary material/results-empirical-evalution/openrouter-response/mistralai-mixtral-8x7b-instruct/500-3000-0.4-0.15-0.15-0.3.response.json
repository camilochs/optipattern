Based on this observation, we can infer that all metrics are important for the influence calculation. Therefore, we can assign equal weights to the alpha values.\n\nalpha\\_1 = 0.2\nalpha\\_2 = 0.2\nalpha\\_3 = 0.2\nalpha\\_4 = 0.2\nalpha\\_5 = 0.2\n\nFor the beta values, we can set them to 0.5, which indicates that the desirable results for each metric are expected to be near the middle of their respective ranges. This allows for a balanced influence calculation based on all metrics.\n\nbeta\\_1 = 0.5\nbeta\\_2 = 0.5\nbeta\\_3 = 0.5\nbeta\\_4 = 0.5\nbeta\\_5 = 0.5\n\nThe response is:\n\nalpha\\_1=0.2\nalpha\\_2=0.2\nalpha\\_3=0.2\nalpha\\_4=0.2\nalpha\\_5=0.2\nbeta\\_1=0.5\nbeta\\_2=0.5\nbeta\\_3=0.5\nbeta\\_4=0.5\nbeta\\_5=0.5"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16915, "completion_tokens": 457, "total_tokens": 17372}}
