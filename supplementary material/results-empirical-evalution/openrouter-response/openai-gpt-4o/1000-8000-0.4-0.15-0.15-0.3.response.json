The nodes selected in Graph 1 have relatively high values in these metrics, indicating their influence.\n\nTo determine the alpha and beta values, we need to balance the importance of each metric. Here is a possible set of values:\n\n```plaintext\nalpha_1=0.2\nalpha_2=0.2\nalpha_3=0.2\nalpha_4=0.2\nalpha_5=0.2\nbeta_1=0.8\nbeta_2=0.8\nbeta_3=0.8\nbeta_4=0.8\nbeta_5=0.8\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Alpha values**: Each metric is given equal importance (0.2) because the example solution nodes have high values across all metrics.\n- **Beta values**: Set to 0.8, indicating that we are looking for nodes with high values in each metric, as the example solution nodes tend to have high in-degree, out-degree, closeness, betweenness, and PageRank.\n\nThis set of values should help in identifying influential nodes in Graph 2 based on the given metrics."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 30414, "completion_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 30698}}
