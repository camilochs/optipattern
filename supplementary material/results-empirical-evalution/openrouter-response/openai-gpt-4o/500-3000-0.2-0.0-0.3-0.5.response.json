The nodes selected in Graph 1 have relatively high values in metrics such as in-degree, out-degree, closeness, betweenness, and PageRank. Therefore, we will assign higher weights (alpha values) to these metrics and set the beta values to reflect the desirable ranges for these metrics.\n\nHere is the inferred configuration:\n\n```plaintext\nalpha_1=0.2\nalpha_2=0.2\nalpha_3=0.2\nalpha_4=0.2\nalpha_5=0.2\nbeta_1=0.8\nbeta_2=0.8\nbeta_3=0.8\nbeta_4=0.8\nbeta_5=0.8\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Alpha values**: Each metric is given an equal weight of 0.2, summing up to 1. This equal distribution suggests that all metrics are equally important in determining the influence of a node.\n- **Beta values**: The beta values are set to 0.8, indicating that higher values for each metric are desirable. This reflects the pattern observed in the selected nodes from Graph 1, which tend to have higher values across all metrics."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16248, "completion_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 16525}}
