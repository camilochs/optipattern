Here is a possible set of values for alpha and beta:\n\n```plaintext\nalpha_1=0.2\nalpha_2=0.2\nalpha_3=0.2\nalpha_4=0.2\nalpha_5=0.2\nbeta_1=0.7\nbeta_2=0.7\nbeta_3=0.7\nbeta_4=0.7\nbeta_5=0.7\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The alpha values are set equally to 0.2, indicating that each metric is given equal importance in the influence calculation.\n- The beta values are set to 0.7, suggesting that the desirable results for each metric are relatively high, indicating a preference for nodes with higher values in each metric.\n\nThis is a balanced approach, assuming that all metrics contribute equally to the influence of a node. Adjustments can be made based on further analysis or specific requirements."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29790, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 30036}}
