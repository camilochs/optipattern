Based on the analysis of the solution nodes from Graph 1 and the metrics from Graph 2, the following alpha and beta values are inferred:

alpha_1=0.15
alpha_2=0.25
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.10
alpha_5=0.30
beta_1=0.60
beta_2=0.70
beta_3=0.80
beta_4=0.50
beta_5=0.40

The rationale behind these values:

1. The out-degree (alpha_2 and beta_2) seems to be an important factor, as many solution nodes in Graph 1 have relatively high out-degree values. Therefore, a higher alpha_2 and beta_2 are assigned.

2. The pagerank (alpha_5 and beta_5) also appears to be influential, with several solution nodes having high pagerank values. Thus, alpha_5 is given the highest weight, while beta_5 is set to a moderate value.

3. Closeness centrality (alpha_3 and beta_3) seems to have some impact, with many solution nodes having values around 0.8 or higher. Therefore, alpha_3 and beta_3 are assigned moderate values.

4. In-degree (alpha_1 and beta_1) and betweenness centrality (alpha_4 and beta_4) appear to have less influence compared to the other metrics. Hence, they are given lower alpha and beta values.

The sum of all alpha values equals 1, and the beta values are set based on the observed patterns in the solution nodes' metrics from Graph 1.
