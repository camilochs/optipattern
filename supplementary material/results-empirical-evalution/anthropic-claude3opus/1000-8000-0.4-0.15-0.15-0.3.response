Based on the analysis of the solution nodes from Graph 1 and the metrics from Graph 2, the following alpha and beta values are inferred:

alpha_1=0.15
alpha_2=0.25
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.15
alpha_5=0.25
beta_1=0.60
beta_2=0.50
beta_3=0.90
beta_4=0.50
beta_5=0.50

The rationale for these values:

- alpha_2 and alpha_5 are assigned higher weights (0.25 each) as the out-degree (ODN) and PageRank (PR) metrics seem to have a stronger correlation with the selected nodes in Graph 1. Nodes with higher out-degree and PageRank are more likely to be influential.

- alpha_3 is assigned a moderate weight (0.20) as the closeness centrality (CC) also appears to be a relevant factor, with many selected nodes having high closeness values.

- alpha_1 and alpha_4 are assigned lower weights (0.15 each) as the in-degree (IDN) and betweenness centrality (BC) seem to have a weaker correlation with the selected nodes.

- beta_1 is set to 0.60, indicating that nodes with in-degree values closer to 0.60 are more desirable.

- beta_2 is set to 0.50, suggesting that nodes with out-degree values around 0.50 are preferred.
...

- beta_4 and beta_5 are both set to 0.50, indicating that nodes with betweenness centrality and PageRank values near 0.50 are favored.

These alpha and beta values aim to capture the patterns observed in the selection of influential nodes in Graph 1 based on the metrics provided in Graph 2. The sigmoid function will map the weighted metrics to a probability range, helping to identify the most influential nodes.
