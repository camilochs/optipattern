Based on the analysis of the solution nodes from Graph 1 and the metrics from Graph 2, the following alpha and beta values are inferred:

alpha_1=0.15
alpha_2=0.30
alpha_3=0.20
alpha_4=0.15
alpha_5=0.20
beta_1=0.60
beta_2=0.50
beta_3=0.80
beta_4=0.50
beta_5=0.40

The reasoning behind these values:

1. The out-degree (alpha_2) seems to have a higher importance compared to the in-degree (alpha_1), as the solution nodes in Graph 1 generally have higher out-degree values. Therefore, alpha_2 is assigned a higher weight of 0.30, while alpha_1 is assigned a lower weight of 0.15.

2. The closeness centrality (alpha_3) appears to be an important factor, with solution nodes having relatively high closeness values. Thus, alpha_3 is assigned a weight of 0.20.

3. The betweenness centrality (alpha_4) seems to have a moderate influence, so alpha_4 is assigned a weight of 0.15.

4. The PageRank (alpha_5) also appears to have a notable impact, with some solution nodes having high PageRank values. Therefore, alpha_5 is assigned a weight of 0.20.

5. The beta values are adjusted based on the observed patterns in the solution nodes. For example, beta_1 (in-degree) is set to 0.60, indicating that favorable in-degree values are expected to be slightly higher than the median. Similarly, beta_3 (closeness) is set to 0.80, suggesting that higher closeness values are preferred.

These alpha and beta values are inferred based on the limited information provided and may need to be further refined with more data and analysis.
